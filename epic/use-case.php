Use Case: Its 1:00 PM on a Sunday and Juan Carlos is enjoying his only day off with his three kids. He already has two
older dogs (ages 8+) and is looking to add a younger puppy to his family for his kids. Also, he has recently moved Due to lack of time with his schedule
on his days off he wants to just spend the day with daily errands, friends, and family. He does not have the time nor want
to check every website in the Albuquerque area or check every pound for a rottweiler puppy. Rottweiler puppies are in huge
demand and are not up for foster for too long.
